If you upgrade your car, you're able to tune the specific components.

As HokiHoshi explains in this video bellow

 It could be a good idea to tune your car based on the following formula

(Max – Min) * W%) – Min = Setting

to get the middle values your settings. But in general, I like my cars to set up a bit softer than the middle value.

Depends on what surface do I want to use my car, I like to change the setting by the same ratio on every component.

I pre-defined three modes: Asphalt, Mixed and Off Road. Depends on which mode I choose the tool will give me the modified “Recommended” value as well.

This script requires python3, and docopt and colorama libraries.
